Understanding & Needfinding
Given the challenge from Bayer and the teams relatively little knowledge about the processes in the pharmaceutical industry it was very important to first learn more about the pharmaceutical industry and health care industry in general. 
In order to achieve this goal, a lot of online research as well as, interviews with all different players in the health care environment were undertaken. In this chapter we are going to present the key findings from the research phase, including a detailed view on real-life evidence. (CS)
The Vision of RLE
Definition
Real life evidence, often also referred to as real world evidence, is a term used in the healthcare industry to describe the process of proving a drug’s properties, based on data collected outside of controlled clinical trials, after the drug has been approved by the governmental authority and has hit the market.
History
The term real life evidence is relatively new, as the need for such kind of evidence was not as strong 10 to 15 years ago. Looking at the drug’s approval process back then, the pharmaceutical industry, which had developed a new drug, carried out multiple clinical studies in different settings and handed in all the results to the regulating authority. After one to two years and many adjustments demanded by the authority, the drug would be approved, when all requirements were met and benefits shown. During this process the price for the drug was also set. Thereafter the pharmaceutical company would perform studies on the new released drug, for example regarding safety, on a voluntary basis on their own.This process has changed lately in a way, that other stakeholders are now demanding more proof from the pharmaceutical companies.
Reasons
Governmental authorities are one of those stakeholders. For them safety of the drug is a major driver, forcing pharmaceutical companies to continue studying their drugs after market access. In the US for example, in 2007, the laws were changed, allowing the US Food and Drug Administration, short FDA, to demand ongoing post approval studies from the pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug’s approval [ref].
The other key stakeholder playing a more important role in regards to real life evidence are the health insurance companies. They are requiring increasingly sophisticated proof of the efficiency of a drug in a real world setting in order to decide on their internal policies regarding, which customer should receive a certain drug. From the pharmaceutical point of view this can be seen as another restriction or as an opportunity to closer work with the insurance companies in order to more efficiently proof drugs superiority over others in a certain targeted patient group.
One of the key driving factors for the just described change in the process was the technological advancement in the IT-sector and the use of it in the whole health care environment, especially in the field of big data. As each stakeholder, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical industry, hospitals and physicians, researchers and governmental institutes, is capturing an ever growing amount of data on the health care processes. Especially interesting are the patient record data in regards to drug usage and efficiency for the real life evidence, but also any studies on the drugs impact on patients outside the clinical setting, in the real world, are of high relevance.
Future Challenges
Real Life Evidence is a relatively young discipline and therefore many challenges still have to be resolved.
One of the issues of Real Life Evidence is that the cooperation between the stakeholders is still in an early phase and could be stronger. 
A huge problem is the topic of data sharing: as mentioned above every stakeholder is collecting more and more data, but how can this data be shared in order to make the most sense of it? Procedures which assure privacy, enable meaningful statistical analyses and allow stakeholders to collaborate have to be developed.As we are dealing with critical data from patients, there is no easy way to interconnect the different data silos from the stakeholders, without asking for permission or disobeying laws. Briefly mentioning these problems it should become evident that there is huge potential once the big barriers have been worked on.
So in an ideal world closer cooperation between the stakeholder can benefit everyone in the health care environment and cut costs by billions a year in the US alone [ref]. (CS)




Research (Martti, In prgress…)
To understand the actual potential of real life evidence in pharmaceutical research it is vital to observe this topic from all possible perspectives. Like mentioned, our team has not vast knowledge from this field from before but this also provides us a benefit to observe this topic neutrally. As a starting point our design brief describes how real life evidence can be used internally at bayer for example in the market access process of a new drug. After researching the topic it fastly came evident that the potential of real life evidence is much more than that. To cover as many aspects to real life evidence as possible our team has done lots of research and benchmarking at various fields. In our research we have so far covered the following topics. First, the healthcare system will be briefly introduced to give an idea about the environment where we are working in our project. Secondly, the drug development process will be introduced to give a short description about our liaisons interest in our project.


Health Care System


To understand the environment of medical research it is vital to understand who are the key players and decision makers in occurring health care system. Since our design brief doesn’t require us to work on any specific country or are we have to start by finding common factors that affect the health care in each region. After general desk research we were able to point out the following parties:


* Private health care


Private healthcare means privately funded health care providers including private hospitals, clinics, dentist, doctors and nurses. The term is more often used in European countries and other economies that have public healthcare system. Although these institutions are privately funded they are in almost all the cases regulated by government. Examples of private healthcare clinics would be Terveystalo in Finland and Helios Hospital Group in germany


* Public health care


Public healthcare differs from the public ones by being funded by the government. The fund is very often controlled directly by the government or by an agency of the government for the benefit of the entire population. Social health insurance is usually required from the citizens to be applicable for public health care services. In finland KELA is the social insurance institution and its directly founded from taxes. 


* Pharmacies


Pharmacies in our context mean drugstores that selling prescription and non-prescription medicine and pharmaceuticals. Basically pharmacies act as an intermediary between medicine manufacturers and government since provided medicine is in most of the regions regulated by government and the pricing policies differ among the countries. Also pharmacies can be either private or public.


* Social (public) health insurance


Social health insurance insures national population partly or in its totaly on healthcare costs. usually this insurance is instituted as a program of health care reform. Funding mechanisms of vary among the countries but usually primary sourcing is taxes or premiums paid by participants.


* Private health Insurance


Private health insurances are provided by private insurance companies. These insurances are directly paid by the participants or his/hers employer. Coverage amounts are usually much higher than in a social health insurance and private sector health services can be used as well. On the other hand services are usually limited for certain practitioners that the insurance companies are cooperating with. However, more wider service network and additional features can be used by paying for a better insurance. 
* Pharmaceutical industry


Pharmaceutical industries are the first sector to look at when trying to understand the environment of our project. Pharmaceutical companies, like Bayer, are medicine manufacturers who are developing and producing drugs to be used for licensed medical purposes. Due to high impact on users (patients) health, these companies are strictly controlled by variety of laws and regulations set by regional governments. 


* Governmental Authorities


Like mentioned in previous paragraphs different governmental authorities have huge impact to national health care. The department that is focusing on issues and topics concerning general health of citizens is often called a ministry of health or the health department. Health governance in each country but some similarities can be found
For example, In Finland the main governmental authority controlling the healthcare sector is called the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (MSAH) and it is responsible for social and health policy planning, supervision and implementation. As part of the Council of State this ministry is preparing new law proposals and  advising government in implementation process of relevant law reforms. MSAH is responsible of following sectors:
* health and welfare promotion, disease prevention, and social problems
* social- and health care services
* medicine regulations
* national health protection and radiation hazards
* regulation of chemicals and genomic technologies
* income security
* equal values
In addition, MSAH has subdivisions (such as pricing board and legal affairs committee) among which the certain tasks are divided.  
In terms of our project it is very important to understand the complexity of governance of healthcare. Like side this systems vary in different countries but it necessary to realize which governmental authorities are involved and what roles they are playing. If thinking from perspective of medicine manufacturer, governments are often controlling the drug regulations and reimbursement prices that has to be taken into account in production management.

The Drug Development Process (Martti)


When starting to develop a new drug it takes approximately 12 years until it is out in the market. This process requires many steps and lots of clinical research and testing and only after 10 years the drug is ready to be launched. However, this is not the point where the process ends. After laboratory and clinical tests a new drug has to be also tested in non controlled environment which might take 2 to 4 years depending on the drug and the required research on efficacy. The process is described in the following image:


Here comes picture: Drug Development Process (http://www.bayerpharma.com/en/research-and-development/processes/index.php)


This is where the Real Life Evidence comes into the picture in terms of new drug development. Even when the drug has been approved and validated  to enter the market the research has to continue to monitor real efficacy of the drug. Even if the drug would have proved to have positive performance in clinical trials it might have cause unwanted side effects after longer periods of time or when mixed with other drugs used by the patient. 


As an example we can use H1N1 (Pandermix) vaccination that was developed and released only in 3 years to prevent people getting swine flu contagion. However due to it’s fast development process and lack of testing it soon preved to cause narcolepsy symptoms to kids. Therefore, it was argued to have more negative than positive effects to young users. This kind of situation could have been prevented by proper clinical testing. Of course when pandemic as H1N1 occurs it is impossible to run 3 year research in non controlled environment but this was just an example to point out the importance of real life evidence.


Market Access Process
Data sources


One necessary topic to research was data sources, as these build the foundation on which the real life evidence is based. As the healthcare environment differs from country to country, so do the data sources and their distribution between the stakeholders. We try to present the data sources with the highest relevance for real life evidence and their potential owners, taking the US as a reference country.
From the pharmaceutical perspective the most valuable data sources are their own clinical trials. Of course this is the most accessible data for them, as it is stored in-house. These trials are also following a distinct procedure and answer certain questions, which were defined by the company themselves, prior to the execution of a trial, making them even more useful. One of the shortcomings of the clinical trial data is the limited population that is tested in an artificial environment that is not comparable to the real world.
Another very important data source are medical record databases from health care providers, which include mainly hospitals, but also associations like the American cancer society or KaiserPermanente. The data from the medical record provides a helpful resource for studies as the effect of drugs in a real world setting can be examined. Unfortunately availability of the records is rather scarce, because sharing the data is depending on the countries legal requirements and laws a huge issue, in regards to privacy.
A third data source, which is currently already used in RLE studies, is claims databases from payers in the healthcare environment. The data provided in these databases allows doing analysis on the economical impact of a certain drug. Allowing pharmaceutical companies, that analyze such databases, to combine results on effectiveness of a drug from clinical trials with results on economical benefits of the product in comparison to current similar products. The economical analysis can go beyond comparing the costs of a new drug to another already existing one, but also include follow-up costs resulting from failure of a drug. This enables to create more complex statements on the financial benefits of a drug.
A not yet widely considered data source, which yields some potential, is patient preference and behavior data from apps. This includes tracked data on fitness, when doing sports, or on a person’s pulse and blood pressure. All of which goes in the direction of personalized health. In the patient behavior section tracked data on purchase history could also be of interest, for example to retrieve data on their diet from the items purchased in a supermarket. But these fields would need to be further investigated whether or not they really proof to be of value. (CS)


The Quantified Self Movement (clemens)
A recent trend that came along with the advances in wearable technology is the so called quantified self movement. This term describes the tendency of measuring all possible aspects of your personal condition especially through modern sensor technology.l It is driven by the eternal human dream of understanding ones own nature and gaining control over the inevitable death. Well or maybe just by wanting to know how much calories you burned in your last workout. But by bringing these dreams just a little closer for everybody it actually gains increasing popularity in various areas, mainly because the technology becomes affordable and ubiquitous. 
There are wristbands to track your heartbeat and skin temperature while you’re climbing mountains, tons of apps for your smart phone or smart watch to measure things like your sleep quality or your physical activity and web services to add your medical data records and share opinions on treatments or services with other users or recieve helpful analyses and tips. 
Given the assumption all this data were accessible in a single place one could imagine the statistical power this would give at hand. But even with a partial image of those health metrics the idea of gaining data of sufficient quality for scientifically accurate evidence about drug efficacy and safety could be a realistic and promising approach for medical research, development and marketing.
A closely related term is the so-called biohacking that can be described as using the shortened feedback loops about your health condition that are enabled by those quantified self methods to experiment with your behaviour in order to achieve a better performance. As an example one could use a health monitor to measure the sleep quality and various features of your physical condition and try if they can be improved by varying your sleep amount, the timing of your sleep or maybe by experimenting with your nutrition. 
There is a strong community spirit in the quantified self and biohacking scene with active groups and meetups in many cities (references: http://quantifiedself.com/, http://quantifiedself.fi/). Also there is a huge scene of startups and tech companies evolving around this topic (http://mobihealthnews.com/26570/9-new-takes-on-self-tracking-on-indiegogo/). 
Quantified Self & Biohacking Meetup Finland 05.11.2013 (clemens - needs more info)
To get a feeling of the hot topics and gain some background knowledge about this field we went to visit the main event of the Finnish scene that took place in Startup Sauna in early November of 2013 (http://quantifiedself.fi/2013/10/28/quantified-self-biohacking-finland-main-event-5-11/). We listened to a few talks dealing with using new technologies to understand yourself and improve on your own health. It was interesting to see the broad field of backgrounds that people came from and the different takes on biohacking. The is a continuum reached from curing diseases over preventive health practices to optimizing one's physical performance and from experiments with nutrition, sleep and productive working methodologies. We got some contacts and conducted some spontaneous interviews with a few early adopters and startup representatives. That gave us a good idea on what is going on in the finnish healthcare startup scene. 
Quantified Self for beginners: Benchmarking mobile and web services
The easiest way to get started with a bit of awareness about what’s going on with your own body is using web services to log certain aspects yourself. If you are equipped with a smartphone or maybe even a “smart watch” or other “smart” wearables you already have a great start in terms of automatic measurements which is of course the ultimate goal, giving rise to the power of self-quantification. The major mobile app stores are filled with sleep tracking apps using accelerometers, running apps your GPS and so forth. 
Advanced tools to quantify your life
If you wanna go even further there are a plenty of tools specifically designed on monitoring certain aspects of your life. Since this field is so quickly evolving it is impossible to keep track of all the devices and services out there but we will give an overview of the different categories of tools and introduce some popular and interesting examples. 
The first thing that comes to mind thinking about body measurements are sports trackers and naturally by far the largest proportion of products are designed for this very intent. Measuring your physical performance isn’t necessarily a new thing, speedometers have been around for years. But with the new possibilities of accelerometers, gps-chips, optical heart rate monitors and other gadgets being integrated into tiny devices these tools reach a new level. A broad class of these devices are sports watches and wristbands, one popular example being the Nike Fuelband (see image, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nike_FuelBand.jpg, by Peter Parkes). These bring the possibilities to keep track of different metrics like steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned, hours slept, sleeping quality and more (See appendix for a list of devices). 
Beyond that there is another take on self-tracking using tools that are specifically designed for measuring health and medical condition. The motivation on using these can differ from people using it because they are required to track their health because they have a specific disease like diabetes mellitus and need to measure their blood sugar or those who are just interesting in improving on their health, analogous to the users of sports trackers improving on their physical performance. Devices for the former group is obviously the most interesting one from a medical perspective since those are designed exactly for the purpose of measuring specific health features. A finnish company called Mendor that was also present at the Quantified Self Meetup Event Finland offers its customers a device to measure their glucose levels and this information is then being uploaded so the users can review their performance and be reminded of their glucose intake. The potential of information that could be gained by analyzing blood samples is huge and if this data would be available for a pharma company it could offer great material for medicine studies.

Finding representative users / Personas (MARTTI)
As a part of a product design process we developed potential user personas for our final product. A persona is a fictional character with specified features such as attitude, behaviour, hobbies and habits that the potential user of the designed product might have. These personas are good characters to reflect when thinking about user experience and design aims.
Developing user personas for our project seemed to be much more harder task than expected. According to our design brief anyone using or working for health care sector should be benefitting from our final product. Therefore, we needed to look at rough picture of the healthcare system as we had generated it.
Healthcare simplified


In the beginning we thought that there would be only two directions for persona. Either it is an employee of Bayer involved to RLE project (medicine manufacturer) or any persona who has used some medicine during his/her lifetime  (patient). Both of the options seemed  to be worth for further inspection so we decided to work these 2 paths further to be used in upcoming prototypes.


st persona: The Biohacker, Niko Mylläri


his persona was developed to be a extreme user in terms our our project. Niko Mylläri is a biohacker that quantifies himself as part of the daily routine including nutritional medical and physical health by using different kinds of smartphone and computer applications. He does that to store and analyze his personal data to stay healthier and prevent illnesses.  if our brief is to figure out a way to use big data to measure drug performance in non controlled environment,Niko Mylläri is taking it one step further by analyzing data generated by himself to prevent being ill. Following poster defines the character in more detail including a timeline of his typical day


This persona was made in regards to conversations that we had with real life biohackers and the Biohacking event that we attended[a]




2nd persona: Philip Berg GMAC team leader


Philip Berg was developed basing on interviews that we had done with Bayer employees. Global market access seemed to be very interesting and understandable department where this real world evidence is highly necessary. In addition Xarelto’s (heart stroke prevention drug) market entry process had been discussed in many of the interviews. Regarding to this knowledge that we had we developed Philip to be an GMAC team leader thats task is to achieve market access for Xarelto to the french market.





Interviews (Procedure, Summary and Results) 
why who how?
Interviews are a great way to get new perspectives and insight about researched topics. Like it has been many times mentioned in ME310 lectures: the real magic happens out in the world. According to this we in our design team also want to believe that the best way to learn and develop the project to the direction of successful project is to speak with people and share opinions around our topic. As a part of our research we carried out a number of interviews with experts in the field that we are currently working with our project but also with people with different expertise that we found interesting or in other way related to our topic.
In this section conducted interviews will be summarized briefly. As a interview method we wanted to use open group discussion where we used interview guides (developed by us) to give direction for the discussion if necessary. Group discussion was selected since its usually the most comfortable way to communicate with interviewees and they can focus on the topics that they most preferably discuss about. The interviews were done to widen our knowledge and vision around the topic of real life evidence and health care sector. Many interviews were carried out also among Bayer employees since they know the key problem point in company’s internal data sharing procedures. 
Each interview brief includes short introduction of the person being interviewed, reasoning behind the interview and the key findings.
