Current vision:


“Gerard needs a solution for interfacing with data to answer questions and enhance executive decision making.”


We believe executives should be able to intuitively and instantly interface with data to help make decisions that steer the future of a company. They shouldn’t have to rely on IT staff and software they don’t understand to access and visualize information that helps them make important decisions.

C-class executives will be able to hike/travel/boat/etc. to a single room stocked to support them for 48 hours. The room will contain everything necessary to the employee for work, comfort, and entertainment purposes. This darkhorse challenges the idea that we need more data or a better representation of the existing data to make better decisions; rather, we may make better decisions with the existing data if we have a different mindset.
