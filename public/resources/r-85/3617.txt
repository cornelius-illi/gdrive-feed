Current vision:


“Gerard needs a solution for interfacing with data to answer questions and enhance executive decision making.”


We believe executives should be able to intuitively and instantly interface with data to help make decisions that steer the future of a company. They shouldn’t have to rely on IT staff and software they don’t understand to access and visualize information that helps them make important decisions. 


Our solution will bring an information platform to the boardroom which is custom built for high-level executives by improving upon standard BI packages in several key ways. One, our platform will be tied to the boardroom with an intuitive natural interface. Two, it will represent the state of the company in a form that provides context to discussions or presentations in the boardroom. Three, the 


Ideas:
* Infosculpture: a physical sculpture representation of the current state of the company
   * Different mechanical aspects will represent key attributes of Siemens (e.g. the height of a mechanical lever may represent the stock price relative to the previous day). 
   * Only the C-class executives and upper management will be aware of the interpretation, but it can be displayed publicly as a work of art a lobby
* Pod: a new perspective on the idea of a board meeting
   * One-person pods are helicopter deployed into remote locations like mountains, lakes, plains, etc. They contain amenities for 48 hours, full connectivity, teleconferencing equipment, and all company tools to access information. Instead of holding a board meeting, participants take an excursion to their favorite destinations to get inspired. They still work to make decisions together, but instead of being stuffed into a boardroom they are in an environment where their mind is clear.
   * This is not a vacation home, but rather a single room meant to focus the mind to enhance decision making. C-class executives will be able to hike/travel/boat/etc. to a single room stocked to support them for 48 hours. The room will contain everything necessary to the employee for work, comfort, and entertainment purposes. This darkhorse challenges the idea that we need more data or a better representation of the existing data to make better decisions; rather, we may make better decisions with the existing data if we have a different mindset.
* Immersive experience
   * Projectors can be displayed on every wall in a boardroom to create a fully immersive experience for upper executives. The room turns into a separate Siemens site that is of particular interest to the topic of discussion.
   * For example, executives may discuss the state of a particular mining operation in the energy sector, and the room can transform into the mine with access to talk to employees at that location.
   * One possibility is using full 360deg cameras (all angles at once) at remote sites, that map to the walls of a circular (or hemispherical) room, providing immersion
* Boardbus/boardyacht/boardjet to project location
   * Executives can be sent to locations of interest to a particular board meeting to get fully immersed with the location/employees.
   * During transportation to the off-site location, board members can be prepped and have a meeting on a specially designed bus/yacht/jet.
   * Compared to the example in the ‘immersive experience’ idea, instead of bringing the remote location to the executives, you bring the executives to the remote location.
* Lounge room, not “boredroom”
   * The boardroom generally consists of 
* Ceiling-mounted kinect/projector interaction (possibly w/ tangibles)
* There are a lot of people working to create holograms and shape-morphing displays that can display in three dimensions as we see the world.
* Collective intelligence
* Stack Exchange
* Meeting on the beach
* Meeting with an audience
