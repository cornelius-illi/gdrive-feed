Meet Gerard
Age: 54
Role: Senior VP, Head of Siemens Division
Responsibilities: 
+ Manage sector activities, staff, finances
+ Represent sector to executive board
User Group: Upper Management
Likes:
Dislikes: 
family, golf, professionalism, efficiency 
clunky software, irrelevant data, preparing slides
Gerard commutes to and from work and uses mobile technology to stay up-to-date. He may call ad-hoc meetings where new information will be presented on the spot. He needs a way to access this information as well as capture any new information presented. He also needs to hold the attention of his employees so that meetings can be efficient and end on time. He needs to be able to remotely conduct meetings during his frequent work travels. Gerard is often frustrated with the response time and many miscommunications with his IT staff.

Why are they worth addressing: The information produced by Gerard and his group will be distilled as it moves to the executives who determine the future of the company. Gerard is also responsible for many employees, so he must have a way to efficiently view and capture all of the information presented to him without losing anything valuable.
