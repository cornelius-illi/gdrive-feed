hey cutie, miss me? Are you going to hang him from the rafters?


I’ll use the stand for now, but I like the idea of raising him up out of the way when we are using the desk, but lowering him into place when we leave.  Maybe then people will stop screwing with our desk...


Here now.  I’m going to start dressing Gerard… He’ll be cool.  Suit, putter, Dell laptop bag, belt, no shoes…


I’m thinking he is a family man, but who has a one hour plus commute.  This encourages his use of mobile tech in a productive way, instead of purely entertainment.  He is a head of a sub-division after all… Can we make him the head of one of the Siemens sub-divisions?


let’s make a handout :D


OK.  I’ll start dressing him, and send periodic pics straight to your email…  (HM: By the way, I met your buddy Scott tonight at a CDR / JPD mixer.  Cool guy, we have some similar interests.)


oh ya he’s a cool dude, we’re going to make billions together.  I’ll invest.
