Users & Their Needs
Potential User Groups
Boardrooms 
User Group
	Description
	Ways the project can progress
	Administrative Assistants
	The assistants to the C-class members
	These assistants are responsible for data preparation. Assistants are trying to respond all the time to try and keep up. A way to help record information from meetings may be useful to access it later.
	Board of Directors
	Members who serve on the board of directors including the CEO, CFO and outside council
	The CEO does not want information presented ad hoc during meetings, so focusing on this user group might email a new way to interact with already existing and prepared information. Presentation of data, visualization, and highlighting/sharing tools might be a potential deliverable. The facilitation of decision making (a more physical form of Robert's Rules) might have potential.
	Engineers
	Individuals who perform day-to-day activities such as R&D
	Engineers hate preparing test information to present in a PowerPoint format. A way to make the data preparation aspect more exciting could ease their job. It is difficult to distill information when much has been collected.
	IT Department
	People who interact directly with raw data or are responsible for data query
	HPI will have a much better description of this.
	Managing Committee
	The C-class members of the company (CEO, CFO, COO, CIO)
	A way to connect the various sub-divisions to get all members on the same page. Cross-diciplinary data extraction is a key word. We would like to use information for leverage. Independent electronic devices can divert attention. A device that creates a shared user experience can hold group attention. This device may make it difficult to multi-task, thus keeping you focused on what is happening. Capturing information is difficult while maintaining full attention to the conversation. This device may go dark when conversation is between board members and attention is diverted from the technology. The conch shell idea from Lord of the Flies has potential.
	Middle Management
	Heads of departments and sub-divisions, project leads
	These people are doing more technical, raw work, may interact with engineers, and are trying to influence executives to make decisions. We may want to help employees show their ideas to convince upper management of particular decisions. Project leads may call meetings ad hoc–information might be needed on the spot. A data query system, or access to a system, may be valuable to emergency meetings. Seeing data in terms of other data can influence decisions.
	Sales Department
	Members responsible for impressing clients and making sales
	They want an impressive room. They have one shot to impress customers in a boardroom. A room should be high tech and comfortable. The sales department wants to capture the attention of the customer.The boardroom needs to be memorable–it should be different than anything the client would expect. HP has an office with a gigantic tree in the middle.
	

User Interview Findings


User Persona
Name:
Position:


I’m thinking he is a family man, but who has a one hour plus commute.  This encourages his use of mobile tech in a productive way, instead of purely entertainment.  He is a head of a sub-division after all… Can we make him the head of one of the Siemens sub-divisions?


Does his best thinking while pacing in his office.  Has a putter in his office and enjoys the occasional hitting into a paper cup, but doesn’t have the time between work and family to hit the Links like he used to.
