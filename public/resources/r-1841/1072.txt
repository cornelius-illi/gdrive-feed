Web Case Profile Structure


Building blocks and properties for the web case construction
Differentiate between: Company (program level), project




Background


* The context and situation before DT (e.g. the business problem, industry or market challenges, recent trends and developments)
* Description of the original ambition to consider Design Thinking, e.g. a particular “wicked” problem for the case organization (the “original problem”) or a curiosity for new methods
* Actors involved, obstacle and hurdles
* Other problem-solving approaches and initiatives which already failed
* ...


Challenge


* Description of the “reframed” and explored problem space
* Existing and competing alternative solutions
* ...


Approach / Insight


* The iterated solution that worked best in field test (the surprising insight which led to this problem solving approach)
* ...


Implementation


* unforeseen events, diffculties and positive highlights during implementation
* if project: e.g. ways to the market → set-up of the in-market experiments
* if culture: e.g. steps of implementation → order of events
* ...




Impact


* Description of DT’s contribution to the (re)solution of the problem (trade-offs) at hand and description on how it changed the world on a more meta-level → differentiate here between inner (myself + organization) and outer world (clients, industry, etc. …)
* if data available → showcase KPI’s
