Web Case Profile Structure


Building blocks and properties for the web case construction
Differentiate between: Company (program level), project

Intro Brief: The problem; the context; DT’s contribution (see Jeanne Liedtka)


Background


* The context and situation before DT (e.g. the business problem, industry or market challenges, recent trends and developments)
* Description of the original ambition to consider Design Thinking, e.g. a particular “wicked” problem for the case organization (the “original problem”) or a curiosity for new methods
* Actors involved, obstacle and hurdles
* Other problem-solving approaches and initiatives which already failed
* ...


Challenge


* Description of the “reframed” and explored problem space
* Existing and competing alternative solutions
* ...


Approach / Insight


* The iterated solution that worked best in field test (the surprising insight which led to this problem solving approach)
* ...


Implementation


* unforeseen events, diffculties and positive highlights during implementation
* if project: e.g. ways to the market → set-up of the in-market experiments
* if culture: e.g. steps of implementation → order of events
* ...




Impact


* Description of DT’s contribution to the (re)solution of the problem (trade-offs) at hand and description on how it changed the world on a more meta-level → differentiate here between inner (myself + organization) and outer world (clients, industry, etc. …)
* if data available → showcase KPI’s

General Background Info and Data Sources for Triangulation = 
Basic Elements to construct the Case


* The “DT-Setup” (Organizational Environment) → before vs. after
   * Space
   * Name of internal Innovation Program
   * Processes
* Imagery: Sketches, photos, drafts, and other artefacts from the DT process/initiative/introduction time → ask for usage and publication rights → prepare allowance paper I
* Take photographs → get approval for “best-of images” afterwards → allowance paper II
* Links to existing videos on the case (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
* Personal quotes of C-Level managers (at best: CEO); quotes of other key employees from the story
* Quotes from: customers, users, media, experts (e.g. analysts, award jourors, shareholders, etc.)

Possible Sources to construct the Case


* Our questionnaire data
* personal interview(s)
* Social web: LinkedIn, Slideshare, Scribd, Issuu, communities, etc.
* Books
* etc.


Example case → highlight and make tutorial (it’s a way of storytelling)
