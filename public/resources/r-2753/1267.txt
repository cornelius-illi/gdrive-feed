8 Vision and Next Steps / Future Work


The last months was a deep dive into the problem space. We conducted a lot research, benchmarking and needfinding. We gained a lot of insights and already worked through many ideas. 
The next steps will be on the one hand to build onto some of these ideas. We will test our prototypes further and try to incorporate all the received feedback into them in the hope that evolving prototypes really fit the needs of the Bayer employees. In this way we will try to find the best process to share knowledge about data sources between all RLE employees. We will also try to find the best user interface for such a collection of knowledge about data sources. An easy way to find and compare them, as well as an easy way to actually get the data from the source.
We will improve and expand our prototypes further and further until they are perfect.


On the other hand we will try to work in different directions than the one before. Next to trying to improve or create software, we will look into improving the communication of Bayer employees working with RLE and we will try to make the process of sharing knowledge a more rewarding experience. Both are essential to the overall RLE experience as we have learned
