Storytelling :  Experience detailed of Madame Jacqueline
We interviewed a grandma to know step by step what she is doing in the morning preparation. We are doing the storyboard[a] and we will put it as soon as possible in the drive when it is done. But basically she is very organised and goes from the bathroom to her room several time, because in her room she can be seated, and have access to clothes…. 


Dark Horse Prototype v2
We tested and build a new prototype style of the last Prototype during this weekend. We tested it with a grandma.





























































Conclusion
* Point of view of the grandma 
→ it is good, and quite nice to be able to do everything seated, BUT it is a habit to take and she hasn’t the habit yet. [b][c]
With this kind of furniture, she will be able to do everything on this seat, not to go from the room to the bathroom several times, but just have everything in reach in the bathroom[d][e]
   * height of the mirror very important
   * storage space : be precise what you put where, depending if you need water or not, depending of how often you need this product,...
   * be very precise on the items they daily use[f][g]
   * have a place to put the towel and clothes.


* Point of view of expert
   * the fact that the sink is turning around the column is very different that what exist today → it can be very useful, especially for people in wheel chair (usually for the sink that are accessible to wheel chair, there is no storage space, so this solution provides accessibility + storage space accessible around the sink; the storage space underneath the sink, it will be a storage space for stock, or not daily used products... )




[a]cool! :D
[b]would she find it useful to be seated, though?
[c]Yes yes, just that it modifies her habits, but she found it useful and 
convenient !
[d]Would she usually do that? go back and forth several times?
[e]Yep you will see with the story board, 3 times I think
[f]Are you going to have precise storage spaces for specific items?
[g]Mmmm maybe for specific stuff like toothbrush, or soap, but I think we have to let the user as much as possible free to organise stuff how he wants, but just to provide the possibilities to be free. So we will have to find the right balance between to create specific spaces and "free" spaces
